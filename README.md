# Valorant-Agents-Website
Use this website to learn more about each of the Valorant agents.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was for me to learn more about front-end web development by using a framework called Bootstrap, which is focsed on "responsive, mobile-first front-end web development". Eventually, I want to get into making another website using Django and Python as the back-end.

## Initial Push
So far, all I have is the cover page which consist of a minimalistic and clean design.
